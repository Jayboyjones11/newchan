Installing Tinyboard
====================

Installation for Tinyboard is simple. You used to have to import the database tables and [create a config file](config.md) yourself, but now Tinyboard does it all for you.

Requirements
------------
1. PHP â‰¥ 5.2.5
2. [mbstring](https://web.archive.org/web/20121017012357/http://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php) (`--enable-mbstring`)
3. [PHP-GD](https://web.archive.org/web/20121017012357/http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php)
4. [PHP-PDO](https://web.archive.org/web/20121017012357/http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) with appropriate [~~driver for your database~~](https://web.archive.org/web/20121017012357/http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php) (only MySQL is supported at the moment)

We try to make sure Tinyboard is compatible with all major web servers and operating systems. Tinyboard does not include an Apache .htaccess file nor does it need one.

```
git clone git://github.com/savetheinternet/Tinyboard.git
