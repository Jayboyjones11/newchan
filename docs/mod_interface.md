Moderator interface
===================

To use the moderator interface, navigate to [`mod.php`](../mod.php) and login with your username and password combination. Generally, you can prepend `mod.php?/` to any regular page to view it with moderator controls. For example, `/b/res/33.html` would become `/mod.php?/b/res/33.html`. The moderator interface doesnâ€™t make use of the static file system.

Unlike some other imageboard engines, you do not need to have Javascript enabled to use the moderator inferface.
